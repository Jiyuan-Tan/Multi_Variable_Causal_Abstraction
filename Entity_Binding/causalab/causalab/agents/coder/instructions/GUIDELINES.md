I want you to poke around this repo, really get yourself familiar with it.

This is a fairly extensive repo with many highly relevant tools. Don't fixate on just a few-different pieces will be helpful in different parts of the exploration.

You must work until you have a complete solution. It's not acceptable to stop early, even if you are running out of context or encountering difficult issues.

**What "complete" means:**
- The specific deliverables requested in the task instructions exist and contain real data/results
- Not just code that *could* produce results, but the actual output files/results themselves
- Not just documentation of issues that prevented you from producing results
- The results themselves

Keep a comprehensive issues.md file documenting EVERYTHING that went wrong or seemed weird. This is critical for improving the environment for future agents like you. Document:
   - Every failure: errors, exceptions, commands that didn't work - even if trivial, especially if your fault
   - Every confusion: unclear instructions, misleading templates, ambiguous documentation
   - Every oddity: unexpected results, weird outputs, things that don't make sense even if no clear error
   - Every workaround: if you had to figure something out that should have been explained

We're designing an agent environment, not assigning blame. If you made a mistake, that's valuable data - it means the environment should be clearer. If results are confusing or wrong, document it even if you don't know why. Be thorough.
